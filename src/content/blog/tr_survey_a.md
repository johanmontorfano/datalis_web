Our recent survey has revealed significant concerns among participants regarding the collection and use of their personal data. An overwhelming **80% expressed worry** about how their data is being collected and utilized, while **72% admitted they do not know how their personal information is managed**. Furthermore, a staggering **96% believe that major companies are not doing enough** to protect user privacy.  

## **A Lack of Awareness About Data Tracking Techniques**  

The study also exposed a widespread lack of knowledge about advanced data collection and tracking methods. In particular, **90% of respondents were unaware** of browser fingerprinting and device fingerprinting—two powerful techniques used to identify and track users online without their explicit consent.  

- **Browser fingerprinting** collects detailed information about a user's browser, including version, installed extensions, screen resolution, available fonts, and other unique settings. This allows websites to track users even in the absence of cookies.  
- **Device fingerprinting** operates similarly but extends beyond the browser, incorporating hardware and software characteristics of a device to create a unique identifier.  

## **The Need for Ethical and Transparent Data Practices**  

These findings highlight an urgent need for **a shift towards more ethical, transparent, and user-centric data collection models**. The lack of public awareness about tracking technologies, coupled with deep concerns about privacy, underscores the necessity for solutions that prioritize user control and accountability.  

At the core of our mission is a commitment to reshaping data ownership—ensuring that individuals are informed, empowered, and fairly compensated for the value their data generates. These results reinforce the importance of our work and drive us to continue researching and developing innovative approaches to ethical data management.
